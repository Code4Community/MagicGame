# 2025Template
This is a template for using phaser and c4clib.  If you make a project from this, the only things you should have to edit are `README.md`, `index.html`, and the things inside the `src/` directory.

To create a new directory from this template, just click "Use this template" in the top right corner, and click "Create a new repository"

# Running
To run this, make sure you have Node.js installed.  
In a terminal with the directory open, type `npm i` to install dependencies. Note you only have to do this the first time you run.  
Then, type `npm start` (you have to do this each time you run)

# Deploying
If you want to deploy the project, all you need to do is go to your github settings, click "pages" on the left sidebar, and change "Source" to Github Actions
