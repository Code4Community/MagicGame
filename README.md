Magic Tower Defense Game


# Description
- tower defense game where the player is a wizard that scribes spells
- the player tries to fend off a hoard of enemies with spells
- the player is given a default spell that does very little and will never win the round 
- the default spell can be a hint for players that observe what the spell is lacking
- construct spells using scribe (constructor) and set a spells properties
- calls functions that the player modifies
- properties and certain function calls cost a different amount of mana
- player has a set amount of mana and mana regeneration every level
- limits the player so that they cannot have 1B attack speed

# Learning Goals
- object oriented programming
- function calls within other functions
- a more difficult problem solving challenge for students that enjoy killing things

# Student Code Structure
- scribe function that constructs a spell and its properties
- trajectory, speed, attack speed, etc
- 
- onHit function that can be modified for the spells
- (maybe?) spells that call other spells

# Level ideas
- a hoard of tiny enemies that require rapid-fire small spells or an explosive spell to kill, default spell will be a low attack speed spell
- a hoard that comes from different directions, will force player to change tragectory of spell
- mix of big and small that require different spells (spell switching????)
- enemies with a 1 hit shield
- enemies that are weak and strong to certain spells (???)
- different levels can have different spell types
- projectile spells, aoe spells, lazer spells???, etc
